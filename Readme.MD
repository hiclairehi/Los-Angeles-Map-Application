# CivilGrid Engineering Interview Challenge

You have been hired by the City of Los Angeles to build a web application to find project synergies between the City's various departments. One such opportunity is increasing capacity at existing EV chargers within the city as they are undertaking other capital improvements.

In the `data` folder, there are two geospatial datasets in GeoJSON format:
`cip_projects.json`: Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) in the City of Los Angeles
`ev_chargers.json`: Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers in the City of Los Angeles

Your task is to build a web application that allows the user to view the areas where CIP projects are scheduled to take place and highlight EV chargers within that area. The application should include the following features:
- A map that shows the CIP projects and EV chargers, with chargers inside a project area highlighted
- A table which shows the data in tabular format

The application should be built using React and should be hosted using your provider of choice (we like render.com). Feel free to use any other libraries or frameworks you are comfortable with.

As a deliverable, please provide a link to the hosted application and a link to the source code on GitHub.#
